Partner Characters

===========
Toy Soldier
===========

Name : Smashy

For the time being this will be a partner that you come across.
He will always have a winder on his back that is always spinning,
when he is overclocked the speed of the winder is trippled & he 
shall have steam coming off of him with a red tint adjusting his 
colour. His animation speed shall increase while this is active.

This guy can have a skeletal like structure underneath but will not be undead
He will just be a skeleton knight toy. When hit, sometimes his armor will fly off and
his skeletal structure will show. random peices will fly when hit. at times his whole
outfit will fly and hell be wearing the generic wgite boxers with hearts all over it, 
some characters in the field may whistle  and hell cover his private parts and run to 
grab his armor. when his armor flies off when getting hit it will just roll back to
the character and he will put it back on, there will be a 30% chance that his bones 
inside will fly. If they do depending on his part he will do specific animations shall
happen.

This is regarding the bones fly off inside the armor; If his head gets knocked off,
he shall put his hands out and feel around straight and then go to the floor where it 
should be rolled back to his feet and puts it back on. If one of his arms gets knocked 
off then he shall just look at where his arm should b and turn around and pick it up 
with the opposing hand. If his chest gets knocked out then his legs will still be standing
and his head and arms will be on the floor, his head will hop and turn around and both 
hands will be both up in the air waving his torso back over. if its one of his legs it 
will fly back and hop back over,but the character will just stand in place and not 
acknowledge that his leg was missing.

4 abilities

Pummel/Smash - (Starting Basic Move) Ground only, hits the front ground
target only.

Self toss - (Final Upgrade) Character Tosses himself at the enemy
 peice by peice, If overclocked then this shall do an additional
 1 damage per hit. The last peice shall always be his hand that 
goes in a punching animation towards the enemy.

Over Clock - (First Upgrade) For the next 3 turns this unit will 
do double damage. When this is finished this unit will be burnt 
out & require a turn to recharge, may have his defense be temporarily
 lowered during this phase. On the turn he turns burns out he shall not 
 be able to attack and the turn after only deal half damage. After that 
 turn his overworld ability shall be available again and he shall be able 
 to back to normal.

Block stomp - (Starting Ability) this unit will throw parts of lego/Toyland
 peices together & it shall fall down on the target enemy. These components
shall be random doodads from the toyland enviornment & depending on the 
level it could affect the asthetics of the block & colour.

Overworld Ability

ideas, could build a fucking bomb and use that to blow shit up, 
but then why wouldnt he use that in battle?
block stomp could be used as a ground pound type feature in the overworld, 
sending heavy blocks down and smashing everything under it.
he could wind himself up and hold until the button is realeased and do a 
charged smash type attack as well? but the player has his own wind up/ charge
 slash so thats useless. figure out more ideas in time

 the block will be used like a weight such as those stupid crates in the 
 water temple when your a kid on ocarina of time. another use for them could
 be special placed aspects of the map where itll look like a bridge start but 
 itll lead the player to know that the toy soldier can drop a part there and 
 itll connect and not break. once its in a place where it belongs it whall be 
 there for the duration of the game. blocks dropped in spots where it doesnt 
 belong shall be destroyed upon contacting the ground.
 In the dungeon where you use this guy we can have him be used where he drops 
 the weights on one side of a teeter style system and uses it to bring the player 
 up to an area where he cannot jump to. Any blocks that are dropped in a correct 
 location cannot and will not break, they may change color or an indicator telling 
 the player that they have done something correct. when falling they will fall in 
 a particular location, such as if the players location is 1.2323535 on the x 
 and -5.78565 it shall round either to a whole number or half, this shall ensure 
 a grid type location and make it easier for the player to lock blocks into places. 
 as well as marking an area on the floor to assist the player from either side to 
 help the stand in the correct location and use the ability.


=============
Water Warrior
=============

Name : Soka

his name will orignate from Sokka from the water tribe on avatar, Soak as the 
reference and Soka from someone whom I use to work with.

Water Warrior shall be called the wave scimitar. Armor Style Shall be 
similar to the design of the glass armor in Skyrim/oblivion.
This character shall be aquired in a beach/jungle type enviornment?
The armor shall have a wave like shader effect on it. it will not adjust
 the physical appearance of the armor, just move along in it. It will be a
bright blue/ blue type of armor. water type attacks shall not hurt this

 as well? water particle effects will be used on attacks, plus another 
for when they are in contact with the enemy.

behind him and do a splashing motion causing the wave to head to the 
right side of the screen damaging every unit within this process. This
 attack is a water type attack.

Gyser Stab - (Starting Ability) This shall create a gyser underneith the
 single target, shooting them up in the air. this will do +1 damage to 
fire type units, cuts through defense. The animation shall show the water
 warrior stab into the floor.

the partner shall have a small chance, going to say 1/10 where the player
launches the enemy straight into the air but instead of going up and coming
 down, theres a chance where they just smash up, hit a light fixture and 
come back down and the light fixture comes down and hits the enemy unit 
causing an additional 1 damage to the enemy unit.

Hydro Splash Slash - (Final Upgrade) - This shall damage all units in a line,
so only all ground units or all air units, this shall damage all units but 
will do -1 on water type targets and +1 on fire.

ability will be used to make the character get up to heights where he can

 areas/ gain particular treasures. as well as put out fires to gain access to 
pathways that have been previously blocked.

==============
Fire Character
==============

Name : ???

furnace type face with horns
shall blow fire for ability and it shall burn particular areas and melt ice, 
start fires in particular areas that are set will be used in combination with
the ice guys wind outworld ability to help spread the fire for combined use
This character shall have a custom shader built onto him that will combine his
health with his style, he shall have a flamethrower grate on his gauntlent that
shall shoot out little flames when he is using a regular attack. his custom 
shader will have him go from extremely dull looking to red to a bright orange
when at full health. he shall be a big bulky looking unit such as a pekka and 
have horns to emphasis his size in combination with his war hammer, his hammer 
shall share that special look where when he is at full health itll have a flame 
style look in it as if the inside of the hammer is burning, but when he is low 
health it shall look blackish like it is burnt out. The staff of the weapon will
always look the same.

there shall be piles of fire where this unit can put on fire to help with the paper
plane ability where when going through and you hit an open flame you shall be pushed
up in the air. this shall be used to obviously get to places that were unreachable.

another idea for this character can be that he has the heart of a phoneix and he is
blessed in the abilities of fire. he urns for death out in the battlefield as all
great warriors do but upon the story line he shall become somewhat currport and die.
probably at the end, and when he learns that he is unable to die he becomes somehwat 
depressed do to this and if there is a next game regarding this he shall be drinking
in he bar sad with the main player from this game and the archer.

be the way that he goes across to get the dungeon/level in his area. Some high swithes

up and pull whatever switch down to activate it. his ability shall always be thrown upwards
in a 45 degree unless there is an emeny infront of him where it will hook him and start a 
battle.

An idea for his overworld ability would be to use the water guys to grow a tree and this

you can see one eye popping out and do to his sight, he was named king. there may be 
possibly another one of these guys with a destroyed helmet but he shall be shamed 
because his helmet was split in battle and they shamed him for taking it off but in 
truth, that is them stating that the gods have shamed them by making their helmet 
unwearable and he became an outcast. possibly make it this characters father and this 
is his reason for adventure and saving his village to restore his familys honour. The

dungeon where there shall be an open hole and only his ability will be able to help you out.

shall be applied to this ability

There shall be the same Odds that the player in the overworld shall have metal and gem coating when the
ability is activated. there shall be no significance to this other then a cosmetic look.

A use for this is flames being blown from both sides of a dungeon or the shop guys trial where flames
are blown and the player flies in the air normally but because of this nothing is done.


==================================================
Ideas

mage can protect the player in the overworld with a shield? this can prevent being
hit from projectiles in the overworld. such as walls of arrows being shit that pushes 
the player back upon being hit.

Mage type character that doubles up the main players attack
as well as open a portal under them and then they get teleported down from above
