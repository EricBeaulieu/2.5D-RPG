Level Design

fountain 
tree
statue
flower garden
bonfire/fire
music festival like they did in settlers
meteor type thing that brian was saying

use the yeti ability for wind like flurrie from paper mario 
and to use as transportation to the next area via ship

Overall Ideas

Villages with dungeons shall have half the population upon arriving. After finishing the dungeon 
boss that number shall go all the way up to 75% population full, and when the game is fully complete
all cities shall go up to 100% full of course. 

When the game starts the player shall go through and see the main city at its full potential. once a 
certain point is met and it shows the enemy come to life this number will dwindle and after the professor
calls the player to him then the city population shall be halfed.

When the player is hit/ or walks into passive flames. the player shall shoot straight into the air with his bum
on fire and land in the safe zone. The safe zone could be a location a few seconds ago, this shall also apply to falling off cliffs
or in dark holes.

*********
Main City
*********

Shall be a guy that owns a shop that will test the player at every chapter of the game.
He will give away the equialent to shards for each one that you pass. prior to you entering 
him he shall see if you have the requirements met to pass the course. since the first partner 
shall be more of a guide it will be a basic test of level design where the player can move.
every one after shall be the test in order of the partner that you get. once all partners are 
aqquired then there shall be a test that apply all the partners abilities as well as the players
abilities and upon completeion of the last one the player will be given a greater prize such as 
an sun sprite in paper mario.

This will be the eqivalent to the shop like majoras mask where you go with each character and beat it
as well at the dude in pokemon where he would have a hidden area in his house and had to find him. once
found you had to beat his area in the ruby/sapphire series. a new area he made popped up after each 
badge earned.

Seer/ Fortune teller that will guide the player more heavily compared to the game design partner. they
will tell you where to go next for a fee. This fee shall increase with every progression in the game.

Guy with fence around his house locked himself in and the player uses the archers ability to hit the 
switch with his special arrow. The guy inside has a broken leg and you will use either the mage/ or sorceress to heal
his broken leg and be given a reward. maybe they have to be a certain level? also have hidden valuables on property?

There shall be a tree that is planted but it shall grown when the water character helps grow it. once it is grown 
there shall be a branch that will extend out that the troll can use his ability on and swing the player over to a 
new area to grab a hidden item.

final fantasy 9 underground shop, cock fight area/pit. cant afford an item or want it for free then you have the choice
to fight for it. natural game over will happen if lost. there shall be progression in this where the enemies get stronger as the game
goes on. if the player were to do this from the get go/start then they shall face a teir of enemies according to that progression and
the enemies will never get harder until they meet the progression through the story line. if the player were to first enter this once the game
is completed then they will face of the 1st teir still and continue to battle there way up through the rankings rather then just face the teir 
where they belong from the start. 

*****************
Ice Area
*****************

This willbe a norther city kinda like the artic style. there shall be a bay where a boat guy shall 
reside and live in an igloo style home. The boat guy will take you to the temple but in order for him 
to take you to it you must trigger a event prior. then when he sees youre ice partner he will be excited
since he can help blow you and guide you to the temple/dungeon.

penguins in suites for some of the NPC's that walk around and perhaps an enemy?

************
Earth Temple
************

Temple shall be that equivelet to a sand temple. i shall build a temple in minecraft to resemble somewhat the shape of it.
there shall be a door and state that it can only be open by its sand people and those chosen by them shall pass. 
This must be triggered before the player can get the earth mage and requires his help but he shall need something done prior to this.
